# LinkedList
LinkedList is a <b>Dynamic Data structure</b> used in computer programming. Each element in the linked list is called a Node. The nodes are linked using pointers.
Each node consists of data and pointer to next/prev node.

## Properties
1. Unlike arrays, Nodes are not stored in contiguous memory locations.
2. Unike arrays, the linked list doesn't have fixed memory size. so, the length of the linked list may increase or decrease based on the program execution.
3. It requires more memory than Arrays as it stores both data and pointer.

## Application
Linked list can be implemented in the data structure that doesn't know the required memory allocation. For example, Music play list, Infinite scrolling, Image carousels.

## Types of LinkedList
1. Singly linked list
2. doubly linked list
3. Circly linked list

In this repo, the following operations are implemented in singly linked list
1. **Push** - Appends an element to the list
2. **InsertAt** - Inserts an element in the given position
3. **IndexOf** - Returns the index of the first occurence of the list
4. **Join** - Returns the string of array elements by concatening them using the given separator
5. **Pop** - Removes the last element of the list
6. **Shift** - Removes the first element of the list
7. **Unshift** - Inserts an element in the beginning of the list
